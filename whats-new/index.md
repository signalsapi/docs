- Search shows status as "running" while its runs are fetching

## 09.05.2024

  * either add multiple searches
  * or use modifiers in one search, for example, **keyword1 OR keyword2** for LinkedIn ([details](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a507571/using-boolean-modifiers-when-searching-for-jobs-on-linkedin))

## 22.04.2024

- Searches, Filters, and Personas are separated into different tabs and steps, so instead of having to wait until the whole search & processing will end, you can see intermediate results much faster.

![](/whats-new/2024-04-22-search-filters-personas.png)

- Different countries were separated to different searches for the same purpose -- you can see first country results faster, before all countries searches have finished.
- Credits are charged per run, not per match, so, hopefully, you'll get much more matches per credit.
- Previous matches are temporarily unavailable

## 16.04.2024

- The pricing model has changed to monthly run limits. A "run" is one job title, in one country, from one source, per day. To calculate your needed runs: (Number of Job Titles) x (Number of Countries) x (Number of Sources) x (Runs per Day) x (30 days)
