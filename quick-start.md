# How it works

* **Spots Ideal Prospects**\
  Your agent identifies decision-makers and opportunity-rich leads using smart targeting filters.
* **Connects & Follows-Up Automatically**\
  Sends highly-personalized connection requests, then delivers a custom follow-up message as soon as they reply.
* **Always Profile Safe**\
  Respects LinkedIn’s limits, adapting daily to keep your account healthy and your outreach compliant.

# Safe Guards Built-In

 * **Max 30 connections per day**\
  Value: Outreach without risking account restrictions.
* **Skips <200-connection users**\
  Value: Prioritizes likely acceptors, boosts efficiency.
* **Adaptive auto-pausing**\
  Stops on warning, resumes at safe intervals.

The Integrator never blasts or spams. It helps your profile build real relationships.
