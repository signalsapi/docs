Deal Baker Ltd ("Deal Baker," "we," "us," or "our") operates the SignalsAPI Software as a Service (SaaS) application ("App").

### Technical Data

This may include your IP address, device type, operating system, browser type, and other technical information necessary for the App's functionality and security.

3\. How We Use Your Information

4\. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR Compliance)

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we rely on the following legal grounds to process your personal data:

### Contractual Necessity

Processing is necessary to perform our contract with you (i.e., to provide the App and related services).

### Consent

Where required by law, we will obtain your consent before sending marketing communications or processing sensitive personal data.

### Legitimate Interests

We may process your data for our legitimate interests, such as improving the App, enhancing security, and preventing fraud, as long as those interests are not overridden by your rights and interests.

5\. Data Sharing and Disclosure
-------------------------------

We value your privacy and will not sell, rent, or share your personal data except as described below:

### Service Providers

We may share your information with third-party service providers who assist us in operating the App (e.g., hosting providers, analytics providers, payment processors). These third parties are contractually obligated to process your personal data only on our behalf and to maintain strict confidentiality.

### Business Transfers

If we merge, acquire, or sell any part of our business or assets, your personal data may be transferred to the new entity, subject to this Privacy Policy.

### Compliance with Laws

We may disclose your personal data to comply with any applicable legal obligations, respond to lawful requests by public authorities, or protect the rights, property, or safety of Deal Baker, our users, or others.

6\. Data Retention
------------------

We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including to comply with legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. Once your data is no longer needed, we will securely delete or anonymize it.
