# How does SignalsAPI work

* **Monitor the Market**\
  The system continuously scans for intent signals (e.g., job postings) across the market including LinkedIn, Indeed, Monster, Reed and many more.
* **Identify a Signal**\
  When a relevant company shows activity or demand that matches your industry or services, the system flags it as a potential lead.
* **Enrich Company Data**\
  The lead’s data is automatically enriched with additional details (e.g., company size, location, industry) to ensure it has enough context for evaluation.
* **Initial Filtering by ICP**\
  The enriched lead is compared to your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), filtering out those that don’t match basic criteria (e.g., industry, size).
* **Deeper Customer Research**\
  For leads that pass the initial ICP filter, deeper research is conducted, adding more details (e.g., company website content, social media activity) for a fuller picture.
* **Final Filtering by ICP**\
  The system then applies a second round of filtering using AI and deeper customer data, narrowing down the list to leads that align more closely with your precise ICP.
* **Identify Relevant Decision-Makers**\
  Decision-makers (e.g., CEOs, CMOs, heads of departments) within the remaining companies are identified as key contacts.
* **Enrich Contact Data**\
  Contact details for the decision-makers (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers, LinkedIn profiles) are enriched and verified.
* **Makes The Connection & Pitches Your Offering**\
  Once a decision-maker is identified and their contact information is verified, your AI agent makes the connection and pitches your services. Alternatively, you can use your own outreach tool (e.g., Snovio, Apollo.io) for automated engagement.

To achieve a fully automated lead generation process using your own outreach tool, do the following (do it yourself, or ask us about our managed service so we will be doing it for you):

* **Send Email Sequence**\
  A pre-configured cold email sequence is triggered, personalized to the lead and their specific needs.
* **Classify Responses**\
  As responses come in, they are classified by level of interest (e.g., positive, negative, ask for follow-up later).
* **Add Positive Responses to CRM**\
  Positive replies, or those showing interest, are automatically added to your CRM with relevant details for follow-up.
* **Notify Sales Team**\
  Your sales team is immediately notified of high-interest leads, allowing them to take action and begin the sales conversation while the lead is still warm.
