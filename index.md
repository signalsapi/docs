# Introduction

## What is SignalsAPI

In four words, Lead Generation, Reimagined. SignalsAPI is a tool that finds companies that need your services and does the heavy lifting so you don't have to.

SignalsAPI identifies companies with active demand for specific agency services and automatically delivers highly qualified, high-intent leads with decision-makers directly into your CRM at the right momentâ€”when they're ready to buy.

### How

We continuously scan the internet for intent signals like job postings and specific company websites. We then leverage advanced filters and AI to match these signals with your ideal customer profile using deep data insights from sources like website content. Through integrations, these leads are automatically funnelled into your sales pipeline or can hear from you directly via LinkedIn with our upcoming LinkedIn Integrator.

### Why

Imagine this: When your target client posts a relevant job, they hear from you immediately or if you prefer, SignalsAPI sends that lead directly to your outreach tool, seamlessly integrating into your existing campaign. This way, your client receives a tailored email from you at exactly the right moment. With these evergreen campaigns, we continuously add qualified, high-intent customers to your outreach efforts, ensuring your message reaches the right people when they're ready to engage.
