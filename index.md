# Introduction

## What is SignalsAPI

SignalsAPI provides AI Sales Agents which works around the clock, finding and qualifying prospects that match your ICP, grabbing the decision-makers, making the connection in LinkedIn on your behalf and interacting with them to set up the meeting. Think of it as having a BDR team that finds companies actively hiring in your niche and books qualified meetings while you and your competitors are sleeping.

### How

We continuously scan the internet for intent signals like job postings and specific company websites. We then leverage advanced filters and AI to match these signals with your ideal customer profile using deep data insights from sources like website content. Through integrations, these leads are automatically funnelled into your sales pipeline or can hear from you directly via LinkedIn with our LinkedIn Integrator. 

No technical skills are required, we set things up for you.

### Why

With your own Sales Agent powered by SignalsAPI, say goodbye to hiring and training BDRs, increasing headcount and Business Development stopping at 5pm. Your Agent will work from day 1, getting smarter with every interaction. 

The recruitment industry is splitting into two groups, agencies using AI agents to scale effortlessly and agencies still burning through junior BDR hires. Which side do you want to be on in 12 months?

Most agencies are still figuring out AI. You can be the first in your market with a working AI Agent. Be an early adopter and get the best prospects before the market gets saturated!
