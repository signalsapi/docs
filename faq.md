# Frequently asked questions

## What information do you need to fire up my Sales Agent?

Hardly anything. Just your LinkedIN Profile URL, Company's LinkedIn URL & a templated pitch you use in your outreach.

## How many LinkedIn connections will my Sales Agent make per week?

Your Agent will make acround 100 LinkedIn connections a week with a warmed-up profile before it hits a LinkedIn enforced limit. For newer LinkedIn accounts the limit will be lower. The number of connections made can be lower if there are less qualified prospects due to lower demand or a very niche ICP.

## When does my Sales Agent pitch my offering?

Your Agent will pitch a tailored offering either when you want it to. For example, when making the connection or once the request has been accepted. Your agent can also send a follow-up which in many cases includes a meeting link.

## How does my Sales Agent know how to pitch my offering?

You tell us how you typically pitch your services and your Sales Agent will do this automatically, tailored based on the stakeholder and position, respecting your brand and tone.

## How many emails will I have to send to win new clients?

It varies by timing, type of prospect and by what you’re offering. Sending only one email to each lead will likely achieve low results. A sequence of emails makes the biggest impact on conversion rates. Average click through rates (CTR) on a 4 email sequence are 3%, 2.5%, 2% and 1.5% respectively for each email. For best results, we recommend running your searches daily in order to reach your qualified prospects within 24 hours of them posting and before someone else does.

## How reliable are the email addresses of the decision-makers?

Sending emails to unverified email addresses risks burning your email sending domain, high bounce rates and zero reply rates. The result? An unpleasant situation where your sending efforts are futile.

We help our customers keep their deliverability high with email addresses that have a >97% confidence guarantee. If they have a question mark beside them in the platform, they have a >70% confidence. If confidence is lower than 70%, we do not provide them.

## Why do results not show up instantly? How long until I see results?

SignalsAPI is not a database, but a real-time search engine. As soon as you create a search, it starts crawling the internet to find matches for you.

Depending on the complexity of the request and current load, it can take from a few seconds to a few hours for you to see the first results.

## Why do I see more results in LinkedIn (E.g. 3000+) compared to SignalsAPI?

Although LinkedIn may display a message like “3000+ results,” the actual number of unique jobs you can view is far lower. Here’s why:

1) Pagination Limit: LinkedIn shows 25 jobs per page and allows up to 40 pages—capping visible jobs at around 1000.

2) Duplicates & Errors: Many listings are repeats or lead to “Job does not exist” errors. In practice, you’ll usually find only 400–600 unique job postings crawling manually through the results.
