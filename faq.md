# Frequently asked questions

## What are my options for running SignalsAPI to grow my business?

You have two flexible ways to run SignalsAPI, depending on how hands-on you want to be.

**Option 1 - You run the outreach:**: You use the signals to power your own outbound, and we deliver prospects in the format you prefer (pull from the platform, sent to your CRM/outreach tools, sent to you via email). You can test SignalsAPI with a 2‑week trial, followed by simple monthly billing.

**Option 2 - Done‑for‑you outbound:**: We run the outreach for you and book qualified meetings directly into your calendar. You only start paying once meetings are booked, so your spend is tied to real outcomes.

## Do you provide contact telephone numbers?

We do! Qualified telephone numbers are provided as follows: £49/month for 100 telephone numbers, £149 for 300 & £199 for 500. We offer larger packages if you are receiving a higher number of propsects matching your ICP.

## What information do you need from me to get started?

Hardly anything. Just your LinkedIN Profile URL, Company's LinkedIn URL & a templated pitch you use in your outreach.

## What does SignalsAPI need to pitch my offering when handling the outreach?

Once we know your ICP, we only need a templated pitch to start do the heavy lifting for you.

## How does SignalsAPI know how to pitch my offering?

You tell us how you typically pitch your services and we'll do this automatically, tailored based on the stakeholder and position, respecting your brand and tone.

## Can we handle the outreach ourselves?

Absolutely. This puts you in the driver seat. Simply confirm how you want prospects delivered (keys to the platform, sent to your CRM or delivered via email.

## How many emails will I have to send to win new clients?

It varies by timing, type of prospect and by what you’re offering. Sending only one email to each lead will likely achieve low results. A sequence of emails makes the biggest impact on conversion rates. Average click through rates (CTR) on a 4 email sequence are 3%, 2.5%, 2% and 1.5% respectively for each email. For best results, we recommend running your searches daily in order to reach your qualified prospects within 24 hours of them posting and before someone else does.

## How reliable are the email addresses of the decision-makers?

Sending emails to unverified email addresses risks burning your email sending domain, high bounce rates and zero reply rates. The result? An unpleasant situation where your sending efforts are futile.

We help our customers keep their deliverability high with email addresses that have a >97% confidence guarantee. If they have a question mark beside them in the platform, they have a >70% confidence. If confidence is lower than 70%, we do not provide them.
