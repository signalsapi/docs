# Frequently asked questions

## Why results do not show up instantly? How long until I see results?

SignalsAPI is not a database, but a real-time search engine. As soon as you create a search, it starts crawling the internet to find matches for you.

Depending on the complexity of the request and current load, it can take from a few seconds to a few hours for you to see the first results.

## Why do I see more results in LinkedIn (E.g. 3000+) compared to SignalsAPI?

Although LinkedIn may display a message like “3000+ results,” the actual number of unique jobs you can view is far lower. Here’s why:

1) Pagination Limit: LinkedIn shows 25 jobs per page and allows up to 40 pages—capping visible jobs at around 1000.

2) Duplicates & Errors: Many listings are repeats or lead to “Job does not exist” errors. In practice, you’ll usually find only 400–600 unique job postings crawling manually through the results.

## How many emails will I have to send to win new clients?

It varies by type of prospect and by what you’re offering. Sending only one email to each lead will likely achieve low results. A sequence of emails makes the biggest impact on conversion rates. Average click through rates (CTR) on a 4 email sequence are 3%, 2.5%, 2% and 1.5% respectively for each email.
