# Frequently asked questions

## What are my options for running SignalsAPI to grow my business?

Our AI Sales Agent can handel outreach and books qualified meetings for you. Billing starts when meetings are booked. Alternatively, you handle the outreach and simply confirm how you want prospects delivered (daily email lists or direct integration with your CRM/outreach tool). 2‑week trial, then monthly billing

## Do you provide contact telephone numbers?

We do! Qualified telephone numbers are provided as follows: £49/month for 100 telephone numbers, £149 for 300 & £199 for 500. We offer larger packages if you are receiving a higher number of propsects matching your ICP.

## What information do you need from me to get started?

Hardly anything. Just your LinkedIN Profile URL, Company's LinkedIn URL & a templated pitch you use in your outreach.

## How many LinkedIn connections will my Sales Agent make per week if handling the outreach?

Your Agent will make acround 100 LinkedIn connections a week with a warmed-up profile before it hits a LinkedIn enforced limit. For newer LinkedIn accounts the limit will be lower. The number of connections made can be lower if there are less qualified prospects due to lower demand or a very niche ICP.

## When does my Sales Agent pitch my offering when handling the outreach?

Your Agent will pitch a tailored offering either when you want it to. For example, when making the connection or once the request has been accepted. Your agent can also send a follow-up which in many cases includes a meeting link.

## How does my Sales Agent know how to pitch my offering?

You tell us how you typically pitch your services and your Sales Agent will do this automatically, tailored based on the stakeholder and position, respecting your brand and tone.

## Can we handle the outreach ourselves?

Absolutely. This puts you in the driver seat. Simply confirm how you want prospects delivered (daily email lists or direct integration with your CRM/outreach tool). 2‑week trial, then monthly billing. 

## How many emails will I have to send to win new clients?

It varies by timing, type of prospect and by what you’re offering. Sending only one email to each lead will likely achieve low results. A sequence of emails makes the biggest impact on conversion rates. Average click through rates (CTR) on a 4 email sequence are 3%, 2.5%, 2% and 1.5% respectively for each email. For best results, we recommend running your searches daily in order to reach your qualified prospects within 24 hours of them posting and before someone else does.

## How reliable are the email addresses of the decision-makers?

Sending emails to unverified email addresses risks burning your email sending domain, high bounce rates and zero reply rates. The result? An unpleasant situation where your sending efforts are futile.

We help our customers keep their deliverability high with email addresses that have a >97% confidence guarantee. If they have a question mark beside them in the platform, they have a >70% confidence. If confidence is lower than 70%, we do not provide them.
