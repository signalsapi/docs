# Frequently asked questions

## Why do results not show up instantly? How long until I see results?

SignalsAPI is not a database, but a real-time search engine. As soon as you create a search, it starts crawling the internet to find matches for you.

Depending on the complexity of the request and current load, it can take from a few seconds to a few hours for you to see the first results.

## Why do I see more results in LinkedIn (E.g. 3000+) compared to SignalsAPI?

Although LinkedIn may display a message like “3000+ results,” the actual number of unique jobs you can view is far lower. Here’s why:

1) Pagination Limit: LinkedIn shows 25 jobs per page and allows up to 40 pages—capping visible jobs at around 1000.

2) Duplicates & Errors: Many listings are repeats or lead to “Job does not exist” errors. In practice, you’ll usually find only 400–600 unique job postings crawling manually through the results.

## How many emails will I have to send to win new clients?

It varies by timing, type of prospect and by what you’re offering. Sending only one email to each lead will likely achieve low results. A sequence of emails makes the biggest impact on conversion rates. Average click through rates (CTR) on a 4 email sequence are 3%, 2.5%, 2% and 1.5% respectively for each email. For best results, we recommend running your searches daily in order to reach your qualified prospects within 24 hours of them posting and before someone else does.

## How reliable are the email addresses of the decision-makers?

Sending emails to unverified email addresses risks burning your email sending domain, high bounce rates and zero reply rates. The result? An unpleasant situation where your sending efforts are futile.

We help our customers keep their deliverability high with email addresses that have a >97% confidence guarantee. If they have a question mark beside them in the platform, they have a >70% confidence. If confidence is lower than 70%, we do not provide them.
