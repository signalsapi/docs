# Location-based filtering

Use three separate location filters: signal, company, and person location.

Imagine the following: a company from the US hired a manager from the UK to open an office in Greece.

This signal can be filtered by any of the three locations:

* Signal location (Greece) -- select country in [search settings](https://app.signalsapi.com/searches/)
* Company location (US) -- select country in [filter settings](https://app.signalsapi.com/filters/)
* Person location (UK) -- select country in [person settings](https://app.signalsapi.com/personas/)

Simple as that.
