If more decision-makers are identified, they are prioritized in the order specified in the 'titles' field, and those with valid email addresses come first.

## Getting started

* Go to [Personas](https://app.signalsapi.com/personas) and create a new one.
* Write job titles you are interested in talking to, e.g. CEO
* Optionally, select countries they must be located.
